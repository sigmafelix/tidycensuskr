```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

To get started working with __tidycensuskr__, users should load the package along with the __tidyverse__ package, and set their Census API key.  A key can be obtained from <https//>.
However, since the API is tricky to obtain outside Korea, we provide the 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE)
#library(tinycensuskr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```


There are two major functions implemented in __tidycensuskr__: `anycensus`, which grants access to the 2010, 2015, and 2020 data.
