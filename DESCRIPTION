Description:
    Census and administrative data in South Korea are a basic source of
    quantitative and mixed-methods research for social and urban scientists.
    This package provides a `sf`-based standardized workflow based on
    direct open API access to the major census and administrative data sources
    and pre-generated files in South Korea.
